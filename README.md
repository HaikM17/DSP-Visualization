  **Figure shows the FFT of the signal, displaying both the amplitude and phase against frequency**

![](Results/complex_sig.png)

 **Figure shows a complex signal; more complex signals will show a more complex 
pattern of amplitudes and phasessignal**

**Inverse FFT of the signal.**
**This is how MP3 compression works: components that are 
less relevant (e.g. low amplitude, or low sensitivity to its frequency) 
are removed from the Fourier transform to reduce the total amount of 
data that needs to be saved.**
